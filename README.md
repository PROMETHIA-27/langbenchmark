# langbenchmark

Note: This is super unprofessional, janky, and untrustworthy. Take results with many grains of salt. 
The only consistency is that the code itself is basically equivalent between languages; but it is not trying to perform the exact same operations. 
Rust's arrays + slices are obviously going to perform faster than C#'s GC arrays, rust has to deal with drop logic, etc.
